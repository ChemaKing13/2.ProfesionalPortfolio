# Challenge2-ProfesionalPortfolio
#Description 

In this challenge I tried to apply everything I learned in the advanced css module, although it was a difficult challenge and I had to look for a lot of additional information (google, youtube, etc). This professional portfolio seeks to be able to show my current projects and my future projects, in order to show potential employers some of my skills. 


For this challenge I based myself on the mockup that was provided to us and managed to complete it with the help of additional internet resources, such as articles, blogs and youtube videos.
